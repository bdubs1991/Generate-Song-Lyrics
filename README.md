# Generate Song Lyrics

This project involves creating an ETL that allows all song lyrics to be scraped for a list of artists. It then allows potential duplicate songs to be flagged to streamline manual cleaning. From there, it allows a markov chain to be trained and stored as a dictionary for reference. 

Coming Changes
1. This project will eventually contain code to deploy the markov chain itself to flask, for a user to use. DONE
2. Once this is deployed, better documentation of the steps and of the functions themselves will be added.
3. An example of my code will be run, which will have the end result available on flask & heruko for a user to test. 
 
Unlike many similar projects, this markov chain will be trained on all artists songs, so allows the user to choose a list of artists will not be available. This is to better simulate how software engineering is used in a data science context, as opposed to webdev.
