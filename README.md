# Generate Song Lyrics

This project involves creating an ETL that allows all song lyrics to be scraped for a list of artists. It then allows potential duplicate songs to be flagged to streamline manual cleaning. From there, it allows a markov chain to be trained and stored as a dictionary for reference. 

Coming Changes
1. This project will eventually contain code to deploy the markov chain itself to flask, for a user to use. DONE
2. This will be hosted statically on a website as a reference
3. Documentation of the code will be added and some examples run
